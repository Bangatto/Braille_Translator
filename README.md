# Braille_Translator
I worked on this project in my COMP202 (U0 course).
This braille translator is made up of digits, punctuations, special characters, capitalized letters and Letters.
First we convert all these characters into braille representation( in a form called decades).
Then, we convert the representation into unicode.
We also convert the unicode into french representation since there are contractions which are well represented in French rather 
than the english one.
We can finally convert English text to braille.
